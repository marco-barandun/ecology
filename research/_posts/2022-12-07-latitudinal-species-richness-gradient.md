The latitidinal gradient in species richness is one of the most famous patterns in ecology. Most people know that the tropics harbour most species than the temperate or boreal latitudes. During my Master thesis I have been testing two hypothesis which tryed to explain the mechanistic base leading to the latitudinal gradient in species richness. These were (1) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in niche breadth and (2) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in latitudinal range.

(1) The latitudinal niche breadth hypothesis states, that species at low latitudes display narrower niches. Thus, the tropics are richner in species as more species can fit in the same environmantal space. In contrast, at higher latitudes, species display larger and larger niches and thus less species would fit in the same environmental space. This hypothesis is quite intuitive and attractive. For example, it is intuitive that species occurring at boreal latitudes, which experience strong seasonal temperature variations (e.g. in Siberia the average temperature ranges from -37°C in January to 19.5 in July) should display a much larger niche in regards to temperature compared to tropical tropical species, which experience very little seasonal temperature variation (e.g. in Singapore the average temperature ranges from 26°C in January to 28°C in June).

(2) The second hypothesis, the hypothesis of the existence of a latitudinal gradient in latitudinal range (also known with the name "Rapoport's rule"), states that species at low latitudes display a narrow latitudinal range, while species at higher latitudes display larger latitudinal ranges. In other words, a tropical species is expected to display a strictly tropical distribution, while a boreal species might be widely distributed also in temperate latitudes.

Hypotheses about the latitudinal gradient in species richness have been formulated profusely during the last century, testing approaches have, however, been scarce, mostly due to the lack of global ecological data. Now, more and more global ecological data is awailable and I have been able to test these hypotheses globally, on >110'000 plant species.

I have done so by generating species distribution models from species occurrence data and more than 24 environmental variables. In simple words, the model would look at the environmental conditions where a species is known to occur and learn under which conditions the species is most likely to be present. From these models, I computed the environmental breadth of the species by comparing the variance in environmental conditions within the area in which the species is predicted to those where the the species was predicted to be absent.
