I am a quantitative ecologist fascinated by diversity of life forms that our planet has to harbour. Currently I am working modelling the distribution of species and their envirnmental breadth in order to test fundamental hypotheses describing the distribution of species richness on Earth.

In my free time I am a die hard plant chaser (as you can see under the [plants](https://marco-barandun.github.io/ecology/plants) section), I enjoy diving, love cooking and a good book. Ss this page exists, I apparently have a weak spot for coding as well :)
