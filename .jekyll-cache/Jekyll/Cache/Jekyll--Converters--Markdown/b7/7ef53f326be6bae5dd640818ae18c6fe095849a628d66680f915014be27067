I"µ<p>Sex chromosomes of many model organisms are evolutionary old. In fact, in oder to understand the mechanisms of the evolution of sex chromosomes younger study systems are needed. During this project, I used a double-digest Restriction site Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach coupled to a privacy rarefaction analysis to detect sex-specific genetic markers in the evolutionary young <em>Silene acaulis</em> species complex.</p>
