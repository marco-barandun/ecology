I"¨<p>Sex chromosomes of many model organisms are evolutionary old. In fact, in oder to understand the mechanisms of the evolution of sex chromosomes younger study systems are needed.</p>

<p>During this project, I used a double-digest Restriction site Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach coupled to a privacy rarefaction analysis to detect sex-specific genetic markers in the evolutionary young <em>Silene acaulis</em> species complex.</p>

<p>Here we try to detect sex-specific markers in plants in the evolutionarily young Silene acaulis species complex using double-digest Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing approach coupled to a privacy rarefaction analysis.</p>
