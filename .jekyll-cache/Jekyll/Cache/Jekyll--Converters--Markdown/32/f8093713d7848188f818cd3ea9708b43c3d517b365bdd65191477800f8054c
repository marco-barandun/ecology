I"š<p>Sex chromosomes of many model organisms are evolutionary old. In fact, in oder to understand the mechanisms of the evolution of sex chromosomes younger study systems are needed. During this project, I used a double-digest Restriction site Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach coupled to a privacy rarefaction analysis to detect sex-specific genetic markers in the evolutionary young <em>Silene acaulis</em> species complex.</p>

<p>Dioecy is relatively rare in the plant kingdom. In fact, only 5-6% of angiosperm plant species have separate male and female plants. The genus <em>Silene</em> is a particularly well suited model system to study sex chromosome evolution. In fact, <em>Silene latifolia</em> has been intensively studies in this regards. Dioecy has however appeared several times indipendently within the genus and the <em>Silene acaulis</em> species complex, given its particular biogeography, is quite exciting to analyze. In fact, within the complex, several sexual systems appear to exist: <em>Silene acaulis subsp. cenisia</em> and <em>Silene acaulis subsp. acaulis</em> being triecious while <em>Silene acaulis subsp. exscapa</em> being diecious.</p>
