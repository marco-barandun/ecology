I"<p>Sex chromosomes of many model organisms are evolutionary old. In fact, in oder to understand the mechanisms of the evolution of sex chromosomes younger study systems are needed. During this project, I used a double-digest Restriction site Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach coupled to a privacy rarefaction analysis to detect sex-specific genetic markers in the evolutionary young <em>Silene acaulis</em> species complex.</p>

<p>Dioecy is relatively rare in the plant kingdom. In fact, only 5-6% of angiosperm plant species have separate male and female plants. The genus <em>Silene</em> is a particularly well suited model system to study sex chromosome evolution. In fact, <em>Silene latifolia</em> has been intensively studies in this regards. Dioecy has however appeared several times indipendently within the genus and the <em>Silene acaulis</em> species complex, given its particular biogeography, is quite exciting to analyze. In fact, within the complex, several sexual systems appear to exist: <em>Silene acaulis subsp. cenisia</em> and <em>Silene acaulis subsp. acaulis</em> being triecious while <em>Silene acaulis subsp. exscapa</em> being diecious. Even hybrids between these species can be found and the species are known to have adapted to different edaphic conditions.</p>

<p>RAD-seq has already been used successfully several times in order to detect sex-specific markers and sex chromosome systems. It has the advantages of (1) generating sequence data which can effortlessly be tested in PCR validations and (2) there is no need of a fully sequenced reference genome. The ddRAD approach was chosen as the use of two distinct restriction enzymes normally produces a lower quantity of markers compared to RAD-seq and allows thus the multiplexing of more samples in one sequencing lane.</p>
