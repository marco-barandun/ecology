I"+<p>Western Australia is dry and deserty, right? Well, most of it is, trust me. But the south-west corner experiences around 1200mm of annual average rainfall leading to the formation of bogs. In fact, the mediterranean bog environments of Western Australia are EXCEPTIONAL. Unique flora could develop over the long time periods of isolation from the rest of the world. From complex orchids, to giant Eucalypts and crazy carnivorous plants, this place down under has so much to offer to botanists.</p>

<p>After driving south for more than 6000 kilometers from Broome, I finally arrived in the legendary city of Albany. Less than 30’000 souls live in this great place. As soon as I arrived I had to explore the surroundings, searching for those unique plants. One of the greatest places to search for plants in south-western Australia are granite outcrops. These are areas where a large chuck of granite are exposed and not covered in soil. These ares are very bright and poor in nutrients. The ideal place for… orchids and carnivorous plants! But plants growing in these conditions experience a big issue: seasonal water availability. In the areas of the granite outcrop where some little soil accumulates, only little water is stored. As the climate in the south-west of Western Australia is mediterranean, it expericenes seasonality in rainfall and summer is rather dry. Thus, these pockets of little soil dry out. This is less of an issue for terrestrial orchids, many of which are indeed tuberous and adapted to these conditions, but much more of an issue for carnivorous plants. In fact, carnivorous plants, such as Drosera (sundews) and Utricularia (bladderworts) are noremally found in waterlogged environments. And this is one of the things that makes Western Australia great: it harbours tuberous carnivorous plants!</p>
