I"<p>The latitidinal gradient in species richness is one of the most famous patterns in ecology. Most people know that the tropics harbour most species than the temperate or boreal latitudes. During my Master thesis I have been testing two hypothesis which tryed to explain the mechanistic base leading to the latitudinal gradient in species richness. These were (1) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in niche breadth and (2) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in latitudinal range.</p>

<p>The latitudinal niche breadth hypothesis states, that species at low latitudes display narrower niches, and thus more species can fit in the same environmantal space. In contrast, at higher latitudes, species display larger and larger niches and thus less species would be able to fit in the same environmental space. This hypothesis is quite intuitive and attractive. For example, it is intuitive that species occurring at boreal latitudes, which thus experience very strong seasonal temperature variations (e.g. in Siberia the average temperature ranges from -37Â°C in January to 19.5 in July) should display a much larger niche in regards to temperature compared to tropical tropical species, which experience very little seasonal temperature variation (e.g. in Singapore the average temperature ranges from 26Â°C in January to 28Â°C in June).</p>
