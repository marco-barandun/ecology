I"ö<p>Western Australia is dry and deserty, right? Well, most of it is, trust me. But the south-west corner experiences around 1200mm of annual average rainfall leading to the formation of bogs. In fact, the mediterranean bog environments of Western Australia are EXCEPTIONAL. Unique flora could develop over the long time periods of isolation from the rest of the world. From complex orchids, to giant Eucalypts and crazy carnivorous plants, this place down under has so much to offer to botanists.</p>
