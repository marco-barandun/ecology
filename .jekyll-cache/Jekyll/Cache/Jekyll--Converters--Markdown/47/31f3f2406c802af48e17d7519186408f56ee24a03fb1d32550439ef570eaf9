I"8<p>I am a quantitative ecologist fascinated by diversity of life forms that our planet has to harbour. Currently I am working modelling the distribution of species and their envirnmental breadth in order to test fundamental hypotheses describing the distribution of species richness on Earth.</p>

<p>In my free time I am a die hard plant chaser (as you can see under the <a href="https://marco-barandun.github.io/ecology/plants">plants</a> section), I enjoy diving, love cooking and a good book. And as this page exists, I apparently have a weak spot for coding.</p>
