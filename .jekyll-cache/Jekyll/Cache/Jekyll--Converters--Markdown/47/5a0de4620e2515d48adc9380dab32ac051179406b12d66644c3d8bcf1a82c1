I"ò<p>The latitudinal gradient in species richness is one of the most famous patterns in ecology. Most people know that the tropics harbour more species than the temperate or boreal latitudes. During my Master thesis I have been testing two hypothesis which tryed to explain the mechanistic base leading to the latitudinal gradient in species richness. These were (1) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in niche breadth and (2) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in latitudinal range.</p>
