I"õ<p>The latitudinal gradient in species richness is one of the best-known patterns in ecology. Most people know that there are more species in the tropics than in temperate or boreal latitudes. During my Master thesis I have been testing two hypothesis which tryed to explain the mechanistic base leading to the latitudinal gradient in species richness. These were (1) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in niche breadth and (2) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in latitudinal range.</p>
