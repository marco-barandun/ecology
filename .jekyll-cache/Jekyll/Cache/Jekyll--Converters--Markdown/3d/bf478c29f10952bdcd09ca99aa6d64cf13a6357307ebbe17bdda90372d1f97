I"[<p>I am a quantitative ecologist fascinated by diversity of life forms that our planet has to harbour. I am particularly interested on how biotic and abiotic factors influence the distribution of life on Earth. In particular, I am interested in projects with a strong experimental approach, which allow conclusions to the generalised at a global scale and which have an applicable outcomes.</p>

<p>The interactions between plants and the environment represent the questions that fuel my passion to study ecology: What are the factors limiting species distributions? Are they mainly of abiotic or of biotic nature? How do they link to biodiversity? Why are some areas more biodiverse than others? What will be the impact of climate change?</p>

<p>Currently I am working modelling the distribution of species and their envirnmental breadth in order to test fundamental hypotheses describing the distribution of species richness on Earth.</p>

<p>In my free time I am a die hard plant chaser, I enjoy diving, love cooking and good books. As this page exists, I apparently have a weak spot for coding as well :)</p>
